# OpenCV-Face-Recognition-Deployment-In-Flask-Web-Framework


Introduction

If you want to learn OpenCV basics please go through this blog. In this blog, we are going to cover face detection with Flask API Deployment. The short introduction for OpenCV is a Python library that is designed to solve computer vision problems. It is used in various applications such as face detection, video capturing, tracking moving objects, and object disclosure.


Flask API


Flask is a widely used micro web framework for creating APIs in Python. It is a simple yet powerful web framework that is designed to get started quickly and easily, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.
